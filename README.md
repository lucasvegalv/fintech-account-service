# Fintech Account Service

This service has purely practical and educational purposes. In it I try to put into practice different concepts that I have been studying in the last time and I find very interesting. Some of them are Domain Driven Design, Test Driven Development, Object Driven Software Design Heuristics and Event Sourcing. Also, to build some cool project with Kotlin :)
